The ``MenuTransition`` component is used internally by the Menu component to provide a scale and fade animation for menu dropdowns. This transition is automatically applied by the parent menu component and typically doesn't need to be used directly.

.. danger::
    This component does not have a dedicated documentation page on the official Vuetify website. It will be reviewed during human proofreading.
