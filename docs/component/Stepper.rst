Stepper
=======

.. aknowledgement::
    This page is a Python adaptation of the `official Vuetify Stepper
    documentation <https://v2.vuetifyjs.com/en/components/steppers/>`__. All
    examples have been converted to ipyvuetify syntax.

The :py:class:`Stepper <ipyvuetify.Stepper>` component displays progress
through numbered steps.

.. api::

    - :py:class:`ipyvuetify.Stepper`
    - :py:class:`ipyvuetify.StepperContent`
    - :py:class:`ipyvuetify.StepperHeader`
    - :py:class:`ipyvuetify.StepperItems`
    - :py:class:`ipyvuetify.StepperStep`

Usage
-----

A stepper can be used for a multitude of scenarios, including shopping carts,
record creation and more.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Examples
--------

Alternate label
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Steppers also have an alternative label style which places the title under the
step itself.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Editable steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An editable step can be selected by a user at any point and will navigate them
to that step.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Errors
^^^^^^

An error state can be displayed to notify the user of some action that must be
taken.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Horizontal steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Horizontal steppers move users along the x-axis through the defined steps.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Linear steppers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Linear steppers will always move a user through your defined path.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Non editable steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Non-editable steps force a user to process linearly through your process.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Non linear
^^^^^^^^^^

Non-linear steppers allow the user to move through your process in whatever
way they choose.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Optional steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An optional step can be called out with sub-text.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Vertical
^^^^^^^^

Vertical steppers move users along the y-axis and otherwise work exactly the
same as their horizontal counterpart.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Vertical errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same error state also applies to Vertical steppers.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Misc
----

Alternative label with errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The error state can also be applied to the alternative label style.

.. todo::

    The stepper component requires a active kernel to function correctly.
    We cannot port the examples yet in this documentation.

Dynamic steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Steppers can have their steps dynamically added or removed. If a currently
active step is removed, be sure to account for this by changing the applied
model.
