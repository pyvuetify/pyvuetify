The ``CarouselReverseTransition`` component is used internally by the Carousel component to provide reverse slide animations when navigating backwards through carousel items. This transition is automatically applied by the parent carousel component and typically doesn't need to be used directly.

.. danger::
    This component does not have a dedicated documentation page on the official Vuetify website. It will be reviewed during human proofreading.
