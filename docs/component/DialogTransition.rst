The ``DialogTransition`` component is used internally by the Dialog component to provide a scale and fade animation for dialogs appearing in the center of the screen. This transition is automatically applied by the parent dialog component and typically doesn't need to be used directly.

.. danger::
    This component does not have a dedicated documentation page on the official Vuetify website. It will be reviewed during human proofreading.
